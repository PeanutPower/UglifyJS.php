A PHP port of the UglifyJS (https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) software;
originally based on the parse-js (http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/parse-js/).

NOTICE:
This project was never completed nor do I intend to continue work on it. I will,
though, leave this code here for anyone who wishes to see it. At this time, it
is *not* functional and, last I checked, was leaking memory (pretty badly).
